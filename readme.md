I have it rolling every 2 seconds to simulate live updating. Simulated it as 24-hour data in 1 minute increments. In real-life it would only update every 1 minutes to match the data granularity.

* Finished interactive mouseover to view details;
* Haven't fully finished the real-time function; 
* Haven't finished dynamic redrawing on window resize;
